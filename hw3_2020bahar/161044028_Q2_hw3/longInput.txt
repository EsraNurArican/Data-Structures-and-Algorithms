Programs
You probably have some idea of what a program is. You use programs all
the time. For example, text editors and word processors are programs. As we
mentioned earlier, a program is simply a set of instructions for a computer
to follow. When you give the computer a program and some data and tell
the computer to follow the instructions in the program, you are running, or
executing, the program on the data.
Figure 1.2 shows two ways to view the running of a program. To see the
first way, ignore the dashed lines and blue shading that form a box. What’s left
is what really happens when you run a program. I n this view, the computer
has two kinds of input. The program is one kind of input; it contains the
instructions that the computer will follow. The other kind of input is the data
for the program. I t is the information that the computer program will process.
For example, if the program is a spelling-check program, the data would
be the text that needs to be checked. As far as the computer is concerned,
both the data and the program itself are input. The output is the result—or
results produced when the computer follows the program’s instructions. I f
the program checks the spelling of some text, the output might be a list of
words that are misspelled.
